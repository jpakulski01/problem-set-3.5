  <h1>The Evolution of Gaming</h1>
  <div>
    Videogames are a relatively new product, considering they only became widestream and well known recently. But few know that the first "videogames" were actually created in the early 1950s. They were simple, much like pong, but required much larger and expensive machines to be played. Over the last nearly 70 years, videogames have gone from siple black and white requiring large and expensive machines to run to being affordable (for most) as well as being colorful with a very wide range of colors.
