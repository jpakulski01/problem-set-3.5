  <div>
    <p>There are many genres of games on the market right now. They range for first-person shooters to horror to sandbox games. Some have open worlds, some are only multiplayer, some are only story. Some mix all of these together. Below are just a few of these games, sorted by type. <br/>
<br/>
      Note: Most of these choices are subjective, with me trying to be objective and not doing a good job. Also, most/all of the choices are from personal experience with some being based on good reviews from general media.
